# [Deprecated] nodenv is better alternative
Please consider to use [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv). `ndenv` repository is not maintained actively.

# ndenv - another node.js/io.js version manager
ndenv is similar to [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), manages multi versions node.js/io.js. Unlike [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), ndenv automatically change node version using `.node-version` file locally.

    $ node -v
    v0.10.12
    $ cd latest-app
    $ cat .node-version
    v0.11.2
    $ node -v
    v0.11.2

Almost all of code come from rbenv. Thanks a lot!

## INSTALL

    $ git clone https://github.com/riywo/ndenv ~/.ndenv
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.ndenv/bin:$HOME/.ndenv/shims:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    $ echo 'eval "$(ndenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    $ exec $SHELL -l

I recommend using [node-build](https://github.com/riywo/node-build) for installing node itself. See also node-build.

    $ ndenv install v0.12.0
    $ ndenv install iojs-v1.2.0
    $ ndenv rehash
